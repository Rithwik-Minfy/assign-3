**Assignment 3**
First I created a folder named assign-3 in local and created a simple website with html, css and js and then I staged and commited.

Then created a branch feature/update-style in that changed color from black to red for heading and changed heading , then staged, commited and pushed to GitHub.

Afterwards switched to main and created another branch feature/add-content in that changed heading from Hi to Hello everyone, then staged, commited and pushed to GitHub.

Then in GitHub I pulled the feature/update-style to main branch then no conflict came and it got merged with main branch.
